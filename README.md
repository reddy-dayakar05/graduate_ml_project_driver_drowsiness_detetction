# graduate_ml_project_driver_drowsiness_detetction

Our project can be run using Google Colab and our code was in Jupyter notebook file.
Our datasets can downloaded from here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EAo9_gdInB_h372w13ULfFS0TAkM7vYq?usp=sharing)
- Download "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" ,this file should be downloaded from google. This is necessary to detect facial landmarks. Upload this file along with the datasets in google drive, and this path should be mentioned as in specified in the code

Necessary installations which should done to execute the code.
 1. Download "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" this file
 1. Install dlib using command #!pip install dlib
 2. Install open-cv library using command # pip install opencv-python
 3. Intall tensorflow
    

Loading the datasets-
Image datasets:
To execute the code, we have uploaded out datasets to google drive and used the datasets paths in necessary areas to execute.

How to execute our code:
-Download the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) , open this file using google colab.
-Upload the mentioned datasets to your drive. Copy your datasets paths from drive , where it is necessary in the code
